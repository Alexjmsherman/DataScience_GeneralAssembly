        This beautiful 1930 home has been fully renovated to rejuvenate the original appeal of the home while modernizing the necessary features. The front porch and side patio of this home serve as additional rooms when the weather allows. The front door opens up to the original living room of the home complete with working fireplace. Through the renovation, the wall between this living room and the kitchen was opened up to allow for seamless flow from the front to the back of the original house. The kitchen includes new wood cabinets with a built-in wine rack, dark green granite countertops, new stainless steel appliances, and two pantry closets. Two bedrooms are located off to the side of the living room/kitchen on the main floor. This home also boasts a new central HVAC system heating and cooling the entire house. The back stairwell provides access to the addition and to the basement. The addition includes two more bedrooms and a full bath off of a back hallway which also leads to the side/backyard. The basement includes a large living room and large bedroom with walk-in closet. It also includes a sizable bathroom with a large walk-in shower complete with a built-in seat. At the end of the wide basement hallway is a large laundry/utility area complete with new front-load washer/dryer. The side yard provides an additional living space with a concrete patio, complete with a fire-pit, outdoor seating, and outdoor lighting. The backyard is paved providing a large concrete patio behind the house for entertaining. There is also a driveway along the side providing parking as well as a parking spot in the front of the house. This home is a short walk (5 blocks) to numerous restaurants, bars, and attractions on Columbia Pike including Arlington Cinema and Draft House, P. Brennans's Irish Pub, Lost Dog Cafe, Bangkok 54, etc. Even closer (2 blocks), is a large field and playground located at Patrick Henry Elementary School.

        Utilities are included in the rent except for cable, but Electricity and water are included. My wife and I are relocating, and are assisting my landlord with finding a new tenant. We will be slowly moving out of the residence from now until June, but wanted to get a start on finding someone. It's a 2 bedroom, 1 bath that is only about 900 or so feet, but the floor plan makes it seem a lot bigger. It comes with a storage area, and it's very quiet, and extremely safe, with lots of friendly neighbors, and a playground area for those with kids.

I will be posting pictures very soon, but for those whom are seriously interested, please feel free to contact Rob @

        **YOU KNOW YOU DESERVE YOUR OWN HOME SO LET ME HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT**
Basically, if you have a credit score of 620-you can buy now-620 down to 580-programs available to help assist in the buying process. You work so hard for your money and when you rent, it is like throwing it out the window. You just see no rewards!
When you own a home you will see a difference in thousands every year from the difference of your mortgage payment verses what you paid for rent. You also receive hundreds in income taxes every month on that hard working paycheck. You also don't have to make as much income when you buy verses when you rent, (kind of a crazy thought huh?) You also will have much more of a house with the same payment of a mortgage verses a rental. Of course, let's not forget about the Investment! This giving you and your family the peace and stability you have worked so hard for. If you are ready to take that step, we are here to make it happen. Please send your credit score-annual income-how long at place of employment-phone number-are you in a lease now and when does it expire-any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past- Once we receive your information by text or email provided above, someone will be with you soon after. Thank you and I look forward to guiding you through the front door of your own home.  *My information is provided in the reply option above*
*The price listed is an estimated payment--everyone and every home is different*  All Virginia

        You may not know that there are so many advantages to buying, especially if you have been a renter forever.~~~~~~~~~You don't have to make as much income having a mortgage verses a lease and you will see hundreds in income taxes in your paycheck each month having a mortgage.  Own the same home you are renting for hundreds less monthly. Now that is allot of savings come the end of the year!
No more landlords, security deposits or broken promises and have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home for free!
It is not as hard as many think it is to buy. There are new programs that help us assist those with a credit starting as low as 590*credit 620+, you are ready to go!
If you are ready to have the peace and stability you have always wanted under your own roof, and let's not forget the great investment as well, please send me a little information for all applying and I will contact you shortly after.......{credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment and a phone number to reach you} 
Foreclosure 2-3 yrs past   Bankruptcy 2 yrs past   Self employed 2 yrs plus and filing taxes

*The price listed is an estimated monthly payment and the picture shown is for advertisement only*

        You can own a house for less than you can rent it for!  Plus get a tax break that will save you hundreds a month on your income taxes!?  When you move, make some nice easy money from selling the house, instead of nothing when you rent!   Or rent it out to someone else and make some $$$ every month while growing your equity!  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

If your credit is 600+ I can help you now.  If it's too low, the loan officer I normally recommend my clients to use can give you some suggestions on how to improve it.

Please email me your name, number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!  My info is shown when you hit reply.   Email is best method of contact.

        You can buy the same home for 100s less than renting it. Besides it being cheaper you get a tax break for paying your mortgage interest, which will save you around $50+/mo on your income taxes per 10k/year in income you have. So if you make 50 grand a year, you will save about $250/mo on your income taxes. Also as you pay off your loan, it builds your equity and when you decide to move, you can make some nice easy $$$ when you sell it. Do whatever you want to the place without permission from the owners. Feel a sense of pride owning a house.  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

Your credit only needs to be 600 to qualify!

Just send me your name, phone number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!

        STOP RENTING~~~~BUY and SAVE Thousands Every Single Year*****No landlords or Security Deposits!!  
Have 100's monthly in income taxes having a mortgage, none for renting.  Buy the same house you are renting for 100's less.  The combination between the two comes up to 1000's saved every year!  You actually have to make more income renting verses buying.
Wait, we can't forget about the Huge INVESTMENT~~~~~~~Credit 600 or better?  YES?
Then come let me help you find that dream home you have always wanted and have worked so hard for, instead of giving it to someone else to own a home.  We have all the little to no money down loans available(upon qualifying) and more options to help with lower monthly payment.  I can work with the seller trying to get them to pay most to all your closing costs.  Once approved, I will send you a listing of all homes available in your approval range.  If you could let us know a little information to get us started, we will contact you shortly after.

        No specials here or buy one get one free, or get your first 500 dollars off or free gift card ect...
Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings of almost 300 dollars every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when your renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. 
*WE HAVE ""EVERY"" LITTLE TO NO DOWN PAYMENT LOAN AVAILABLE* and I can help get the seller to contribute to paying most to all of your closing costs!
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment?  Then please contact Tracy.  I am a licensed professional real estate agent and I am partnered with several excellent licensed lenders.  My information  is provided in the reply option above.
