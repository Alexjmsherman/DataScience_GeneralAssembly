        This is the only rental like this in N Va, and the current renter for 4 years is moving out so it will be available May 1 for move-in. The cottage includes kitchenette, small bedroom, full bath/shower, loft, porch, access to laundry facilities in main house. $1,350 rent + deposit, and sits on four wooded acres with a security gate with the main house and a property caretaker's cottage. The guest cottage is only 15x20 so it is for single occupancy only, and for someone who has few furnishings (unit is unfurnished). The county has zoned this cottage for someone over the age of 55 years only, so you must meet this requirement (it's zoned as an ""Accessory Dwelling Unit"").

Directly across the street from some of the nicest parks in the Metro area right on the Potomac -- hiking, biking, trails, waterfalls. And only five minutes from the town of Great Falls (Safeway, banks, gas, restaurants), 10-15 minutes to Sterling, Reston, McLean, Langley, Tysons. Great Falls is not accessible to mass transportation (bus or Metro) so you will need a car (rush hour commute to DC is about 45 minutes). Although Great Falls is 8 minutes off of the beltway, it is literally the last town in the Metro area with lots of trees and space -- everyone lives on 2-4 acres, and rentals in this area rarely come up. 

Additional pictures at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/15721827@N05/sets/72157602615630977/

Electricity is metered separately for this cottage (around $20-80), cable (cost) and optional wireless ($55) available. Single occupancy only, very very quiet people only who don't expect frequent guests; no pets (cats/dogs); minimum one year lease. Must pass credit and criminal background checks. Please verify that you are over the age of 55, along with your job, location of work, contact details and any other information you would like to share in your first writing.

        You can buy the same home for 100s less than renting it. Besides it being cheaper you get a tax break for paying your mortgage interest, which will save you around $50+/mo on your income taxes per 10k/year in income you have. So if you make 50 grand a year, you will save about $250/mo on your income taxes. Also as you pay off your loan, it builds your equity and when you decide to move, you can make some nice easy $$$ when you sell it. Do whatever you want to the place without permission from the owners. Feel a sense of pride owning a house.  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

Your credit only needs to be 600 to qualify!

Just send me your name, phone number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!

My info is shown when you hit reply.  Email is best method of contact.

**The price in the title is an estimate, it will vary based on your credit score, debt, and area you want to live.   There are hundreds of homes available for every price range, the picture is a example**

        I am a young professional in my late 20s looking for another young professional to share my 980 sqft apartment. You would be living in the master bedroom, which has an attached master bathroom. We would share the living/dining area, kitchen, and the in-unit washer and dryer. Plenty of parking is available on site. I have Fios TV and Internet with HBO, Showtime, etc. The rent listed includes all utilities. I have included some pictures of the apartment, feel free to look at The Fields of Chantilly online to see other pictures and community amenities. (Note: The income restrictions do not apply to this apartment anymore).

The apartment is right off of US-50 and close to plenty of shopping and entertainment options. Locally, a 10 minute drive in any direction will result in virtually any choice of restaurant, grocery store, shopping malls, movie theaters, etc. The Vienna metro station is a 15 min drive, from which its about 40 minutes into Washington, D.C.

I currently work in retail, which means I get home around midnight sometimes, however I am looking for jobs in government which will grant a more normal schedule. In my free time, I enjoy going to the movies, watching TV at home, playing and going to sporting events, occasionally meeting friends for drinks, especially on trivia nights. I am very outgoing and willing to try a lot of different things. On occasion I have people come over for a few hours and a couple times a year I have family that will come stay a night or two in the apartment.

The biggest thing I am looking for in a roommate is a sense of common courtesy. Clean up after yourself in the common areas, give me a heads up if you want to have people over, don't put dirty dishes into dishwasher full of clean dishes, etc.

The apartment is available now. You would need to put an application into the apartment complex, but unlike other places that charge $50-100, the application fee is only $12. Please contact me if you have any questions and/or you would like to setup a time to come over and see the apartment.

        You can own a house for less than you can rent it for!  Plus get a tax break that will save you hundreds a month on your income taxes!?  When you move, make some nice easy money from selling the house, instead of nothing when you rent!   Or rent it out to someone else and make some $$$ every month while growing your equity!  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

If your credit is 600+ I can help you now.  If it's too low, the loan officer I normally recommend my clients to use can give you some suggestions on how to improve it.

Please email me your name, number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!  My info is shown when you hit reply.   Email is best method of contact.

        This is the only rental like this in N Va, and the current renter for 4 years is moving out so it will be available May 1 for move-in. The cottage includes kitchenette, small bedroom, full bath/shower, loft, porch, access to laundry facilities in main house. $1,350 rent + deposit, and sits on four wooded acres with a security gate with the main house and a property caretaker's cottage. The guest cottage is only 15x20 so it is for single occupancy only, and for someone who has few furnishings (unit is unfurnished). The county has zoned this cottage for someone over the age of 55 years only, so you must meet this requirement (it's zoned as an ""Accessory Dwelling Unit"").

Directly across the street from some of the nicest parks in the Metro area right on the Potomac -- hiking, biking, trails, waterfalls. And only five minutes from the town of Great Falls (Safeway, banks, gas, restaurants), 10-15 minutes to Sterling, Reston, McLean, Langley, Tysons. Great Falls is not accessible to mass transportation (bus or Metro) so you will need a car (rush hour commute to DC is about 45 minutes). Although Great Falls is 8 minutes off of the beltway, it is literally the last town in the Metro area with lots of trees and space -- everyone lives on 2-4 acres, and rentals in this area rarely come up. 

Additional pictures at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/15721827@N05/sets/72157602615630977/

Electricity is metered separately for this cottage (around $20-80), cable (cost) and optional wireless ($55) available. Single occupancy only, very very quiet people only who don't expect frequent guests; no pets (cats/dogs); minimum one year lease. Must pass credit and criminal background checks. Please verify that you are over the age of 55, along with your job, location of work, contact details and any other information you would like to share in your first writing.

Local schools are Woodbridge High School, Lynn Middle School, and Occoquan Elementry.  This is a single family home, so one family unit (individual, couple, and their dependants) should occupy the home.  I comply with all Virginia Tenant Laws.  I offer military clauses.

First months rent and an $800 deposit is required ($3000 to move in which includes the first month's rent & the deposit). For MIL/Govt I also request a copy of your orders for MIL clause and waive application fee.

        No more landlords, security deposits or broken promises.  
Wouldn't it be nice to see extra money in your paycheck every month?  You will in the 100s if you buy!  Having a mortgage, you gain extra income taxes.  You are required to make more income renting verses owning.  Own the same home you are renting for hundreds LESS each month!!!
If you are counting this up, this is how you are saving thousands Every Year.
Wait, we can't forget about the Huge INVESTMENT~~If your credit is 600 or better, then come let me help you find that dream home you have always wanted.  If you could let me know the following information, I will contact you shortly after.  If self employed, must have for at least two years and claiming taxes.  

{1.credit score 2.annual income 3.how long at place of employment 4.phone number to reach you} 
We have all the little to NO money down options available(upon qualifying), lowest rates and more options to help with a lower monthly payment.  Once approved, I can send you listings of all homes available in your monthly payment/approved range.
*I am a licensed professional real estate agent and partnered with several excellent licensed lenders. My information is provided in the reply above, thank you*
*The listing price is an estimated monthly payment--everyone and every home is different**
                         There are beautiful homes available in all price ranges for everyone

This is the only rental like this in N Va, and the current renter for 4 years is moving out so it will be available May 1 for move-in. The cottage includes kitchenette, small bedroom, full bath/shower, loft, porch, access to laundry facilities in main house. $1,350 rent + deposit, and sits on four wooded acres with a security gate with the main house and a property caretaker's cottage. The guest cottage is only 15x20 so it is for single occupancy only, and for someone who has few furnishings (unit is unfurnished). The county has zoned this cottage for someone over the age of 55 years only, so you must meet this requirement (it's zoned as an ""Accessory Dwelling Unit"").

Directly across the street from some of the nicest parks in the Metro area right on the Potomac -- hiking, biking, trails, waterfalls. And only five minutes from the town of Great Falls (Safeway, banks, gas, restaurants), 10-15 minutes to Sterling, Reston, McLean, Langley, Tysons. Great Falls is not accessible to mass transportation (bus or Metro) so you will need a car (rush hour commute to DC is about 45 minutes). Although Great Falls is 8 minutes off of the beltway, it is literally the last town in the Metro area with lots of trees and space -- everyone lives on 2-4 acres, and rentals in this area rarely come up. 

Additional pictures at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/15721827@N05/sets/72157602615630977/

Electricity is metered separately for this cottage (around $20-80), cable (cost) and optional wireless ($55) available. Single occupancy only, very very quiet people only who don't expect frequent guests; no pets (cats/dogs); minimum one year lease. Must pass credit and criminal background checks. Please verify that you are over the age of 55, along with your job, location of work, contact details and any other information you would like to share in your first writing.

        Credit 620+ YOU can BUY Now?Time2change (OWN FOR LESS THEN RENTING)

No specials here or buy one get one free, or get your first 500 dollars off or free gift card ect...
Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings of almost 300 dollars every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when your renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. The list just goes on! If you have a credit of 620 or better, you are ready to go----600 or better---new programs to help you get qualified quickly.
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment. Then please let me know your credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment, phone number, any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past, are you in a lease now and when does it expire.
Thank you, and once I receive your information, I will be with you shortly after.
I am a licensed professional real estate agent and I am partnered with several excellent licensed lenders and together we can make that dream of owning come true! My information is provided in the reply option above, thank you.

Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings of almost 300 dollars every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when your renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. The list just goes on! If you have a credit of 620 or better, you are ready to go----600 or better---new programs to help you get qualified quickly.
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment. Then please let me know your credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment, phone number, any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past, are you in a lease now and when does it expire.

        You may not know that there are so many advantages to buying, especially if you have been a renter forever.~~~~~~~~~You don't have to make as much income having a mortgage verses a lease and you will see hundreds in income taxes in your paycheck each month having a mortgage. Own the same home you are renting for hundreds less monthly. Now that is allot of savings come the end of the year!
No more landlords, security deposits or broken promises and have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home for free!
It is not as hard as many think it is to buy. There are new programs that help us assist those with a credit starting as low as 590*credit 620+, you are ready to go!
If you are ready to have the peace and stability you have always wanted under your own roof, and let's not forget the great investment as well, please send me a little information for all applying and I will contact you shortly after.......{credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment and a phone number to reach you}
Foreclosure 2-3 yrs past Bankruptcy 2 yrs past Self employed 2 yrs plus and filing taxes

        No specials here or buy one get one free, or get your first 500 dollars off or free gift card ect...
Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings of almost 300 dollars every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when you are renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. The list just goes on! If you have a credit of 600 or better---we can help you get qualified.
*We have all the no money down loans available(upon qualifying) and the lowest rates around*
Once approved, I can send you a listing of all homes available in your range in any location in Virginia to view.
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment. Then please let me know your credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment, phone number, and any large debt(school loans, car loans ect.)                                                                    
*The price listed is an estimated payment--everyone and every home is different.  There are thousands of homes available in a large price range to suit everyone*Picture shown is for Advertisement

I am a licensed professional real estate agent and am partnered with several excellent licensed lenders.  My information is provided in the reply above, thank you and I look forward to assisting you in finding your own home to call home.

        You can purchase the same home for way less than renting it.  Besides it being cheaper you get a tax break for paying your mortgage interest, which will save you around $50+/mo on your income taxes per 10k/year in income you have. So if you make 50,000/yr, you will save about $250/mo on your income tax. PLus as you pay off your loan, it builds your equity and when you decide to move, you can make some nice easy $$$ when you sell it. Do whatever you want to the place without permission from the owners. Feel a sense of pride owning a house. You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

Your credit only needs to be 600+ to qualify!

Just email me your name, phone #, income before taxes, and estimated credit score if you know it.  I will get back to you ASAP!

Besides it being cheaper you get a tax break for paying your mortgage interest, which will save you around $50+/mo on your income taxes per 10k/year in income you have. So if you make 50 grand a year, you will save about $250/mo on your income taxes. Also as you pay off your loan, it builds your equity and when you decide to move, you can make some nice easy $$$ when you sell it. Do whatever you want to the place without permission from the owners. Feel a sense of pride owning a house.  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

Your credit only needs to be 600 to qualify!

Just send me your name, phone number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!

My info is shown when you hit reply.  Email is best method of contact.

Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings of almost 300 dollars every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when your renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. 
*WE HAVE ""EVERY"" LITTLE TO NO DOWN PAYMENT LOAN AVAILABLE* and I can help get the seller to contribute to paying most to all of your closing costs!
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment?  Then please contact Tracy.  I am a licensed professional real estate agent and I am partnered with several excellent licensed lenders.  My information  is provided in the reply option above.

Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings of almost 300 dollars every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when your renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. 
*WE HAVE ""EVERY"" LITTLE TO NO DOWN PAYMENT LOAN AVAILABLE* and I can help get the seller to contribute to paying most to all of your closing costs!
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment. Then please let me know your credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment, phone number, any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past, are you in a lease now and when does it expire.
Thank you, and once I receive your information,  I will be with you shortly after.

        You can buy the same home for 100s less than renting it. Besides it being cheaper you get a tax break for paying your mortgage interest, which will save you around $50+/mo on your income taxes per 10k/year in income you have. So if you make 50 grand a year, you will save about $250/mo on your income taxes. Also as you pay off your loan, it builds your equity and when you decide to move, you can make some nice easy $$$ when you sell it. Do whatever you want to the place without permission from the owners. Feel a sense of pride owning a house.  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

Your credit only needs to be 600 to qualify!

Just send me your name, phone number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!

My info is shown when you hit reply.  Email is best method of contact.

**The price in the title is an estimate, it will vary based on your credit score, debt, area you want to live, and some other factors. There are 100s of houses available for every price range, the pic is a example**

Wouldn't it be nice to see extra money in your paycheck every month?  You will in the 100s if you buy!  Having a mortgage, you gain extra income taxes.  You are required to make more income renting verses owning.  Own the same home you are renting for hundreds LESS each month!!!
If you are counting this up, this is how you are saving thousands Every Year.
Wait, we can't forget about the Huge INVESTMENT~~If your credit is 600 or better, then come let me help you find that dream home you have always wanted.

        You can own a house for less than you can rent it for!  Plus get a tax break that will save you hundreds a month on your income taxes!?  When you move, make some nice easy money from selling the house, instead of nothing when you rent!   Or rent it out to someone else and make some $$$ every month while growing your equity!  You don't have to pay your 1st mortgage payment until 45-60 days after you move in!

If your credit is 600+ I can help you now.  If it's too low, the loan officer I normally recommend my clients to use can give you some suggestions on how to improve it.

Please email me your name, number, income before taxes, and estimated credit score.  I will get back to you ASAP!  My info is shown when you hit reply.   Email is best method of contact.

**The price in the title is an estimate, it will vary based on your credit score, debt, and area you want to live.   There are hundreds of homes available for every price range, the picture is a example**

Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.  I am a licensed professional real estate agent and am partnered with several excellent licensed lenders.   I would love to help get you out of the rental madness and into the serenity of owning your own home with no hidden tricks, fees or scams.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.
Want to make changes under the roof you are living under? Well, if it's yours, then you can and you don't have to ask anyone's permission.(Just do it)
If you take the same home and rent it, then purchase it, you would see a savings in the hundreds every single month! Also, you will receive extra money in your paycheck in income taxes, having a mortgage(I don't think you get to have that bonus when you are renting)
If you think about it, this is 3-4 thousand dollars every single year YOU, could have in your savings account, if you have a mortgage verses renting. The list just goes on! If you have a credit of 600 or better---we can help you get qualified.
*We have all the no money down loans available(upon qualifying), lowest rates and more options to a lower monthly payment.  **There are $5,000 grants being given (for a short time until funds are gone) to go towards your down payment!!  So hurry while there are plenty of funds available, they will not last long and it does not take much to qualify.  I can send you a listing of all homes from the ""Realtors MRIS"", in your comfortable monthly payment range, in any location in Virginia, so you can see what is available for you.
Ready to make this step for your families peace and stability, not to include the nice investment. Then please let me know your credit score, annual income, how long at place of employment, phone number, and let me know if you have any large debt(school loans, car, personal ect) 
*My information is provided in the reply above, thank you*

Just the facts on the savings you will see if you turn over to home ownership and say goodbye to renting.
You actually have to make more money renting a home verses buying a home.
Payments as low as 600-650 per every 100k mortgaged.
You WILL have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE.

        STOP RENTING~~~~BUY and SAVE Thousands Every Single Year*****No landlords or Security Deposits!!  
Have 100's monthly in income taxes having a mortgage, none for renting.  Buy the same house you are renting for 100's less.  The combination between the two comes up to 1000's saved every year!  You actually have to make more income renting verses buying.
Wait, we can't forget about the Huge INVESTMENT~~~~~~~Credit 600 or better?  YES?
Then come let me help you find that dream home you have always wanted and have worked so hard for, instead of giving it to someone else to own a home.  We have all the little to no money down loans available(upon qualifying) and more options to help with lower monthly payment.  I can work with the seller trying to get them to pay most to all your closing costs.  Once approved, I will send you a listing of all homes available in your approval range.  If you could let us know a little information to get us started, we will contact you shortly after.

Any foreclosure or bankruptcy needs two years past and if self employed, must be for close to two years and claiming taxes.
My information is provided in the reply option above, thank you.

        You may not know that there are so many advantages to buying, especially if you have been a renter forever.~~~~~~~~~You don't have to make as much income having a mortgage verses a lease and you will see hundreds in income taxes in your paycheck each month having a mortgage.  Own the same home you are renting for hundreds less monthly. Now that is allot of savings come the end of the year!
No more landlords, security deposits or broken promises and have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home for free!

        This is a fantastic unfurnished 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment on the second floor WITH a den/office space. I'm currently using the den as a second bedroom for guests. It's definitely big enough for a nursery, office, library, guest bedroom, playroom, etc. Such a wonderful extra space to have. There is a washer and dryer in the unit. They are full-size individual pieces, not the stackable kind. There is one entry closet - great coat closet or extra storage. The kitchen is a perfect size with a refrigerator, gas stove, microwave, and dishwasher. The kitchen also has a pantry. The bathroom is very large. Lots of extra space to put extra storage units. It has two entries, one from the main living space and one from the bedroom. There's an additional linen closet as well as a shower/tub combo. The tub is a garden style oval tub, nice for soaking or bathing little ones. The bedroom has walk-through/his and hers mirrored closets as well as windows that look out onto your own private balcony. The main living/dining space is quite large. I currently have a full size circle table with four chairs in the dining space. I also have a large wall unit, an 8 foot couch, a coffee table, an end table, a bookshelf, and a tv stand all in the living space with plenty of room to spare. The windows in the living room look out onto the balcony which is perfect for letting pets have free roam of the apartment and outside area. The entire unit has 9-10 foot ceilings with crown molding.  Also, the cable and internet are already connected, so that will save you the hassle upon move in!

This space is available May 28 and the lease runs through February 2016 and can be resigned to extended beyond that. On short notice I am having to move out of the area and would love for someone to take over the lease. Since it's a shorter lease (9 months) it would be perfect for military members, families looking to explore the area before settling into a house, or a student/intern. It's a very family friendly complex and the staff here are wonderful, I've never had any issues with them at all. One of the biggest perks I've enjoyed is the parking garage. It's assigned parking, so you'll have your own designated spot. Saves you the hassle of scraping snow or trying to dodge the rain. The garage and the building are access controlled, so it's very safe. There are also two elevators in the garage/complex. There is a pool, full workout area with weight machines, treadmills, stationary bikes, elliptical machines, free weights, yoga room, and a virtual golf room. 

It's a very comfortable and homey space. The 964 square feet is very very large for a one bedroom apartment and the $1500 rent is very reasonable for this area. You'll be close to Reston Town Center for restaurants and shopping and about 3 miles to Dulles airport. I understand wanting to know everything about a place before you move in, so please feel free to email me and ask any questions you'd like.

        **YOU KNOW YOU DESERVE YOUR OWN HOME SO LET ME HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT**
Basically, if you have a credit score of 620-you can buy now-620 down to 580-programs available to help assist in the buying process. You work so hard for your money and when you rent, it is like throwing it out the window. You just see no rewards!
When you own a home you will see a difference in thousands every year from the difference of your mortgage payment verses what you paid for rent. You also receive hundreds in income taxes every month on that hard working paycheck. You also don't have to make as much income when you buy verses when you rent, (kind of a crazy thought huh?) You also will have much more of a house with the same payment of a mortgage verses a rental. Of course, let's not forget about the Investment! This giving you and your family the peace and stability you have worked so hard for. If you are ready to take that step, we are here to make it happen. Please send your credit score-annual income-how long at place of employment-phone number-are you in a lease now and when does it expire-any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past- Once we receive your information by text or email provided above, someone will be with you soon after. Thank you and I look forward to guiding you through the front door of your own home.  *My information is provided in the reply option above*

*Extra money noticed in your paycheck every week in income taxes, having a mortgage{nothing when you are renting}
*Payments only around 600-650 for every 100,000 mortgaged.
*Can't go wrong with that the huge investment! Have your first 6-8 weeks in your new home FREE! 
Rates are low~~We have all the little to NO money down loans available
Once approved, I can send you listings of everything available in your approved range, anywhere in Virginia

        You may not know that there are so many advantages to buying, especially if you have been a renter forever.~~~~~~~~~You don't have to make as much income having a mortgage verses a lease and you will see hundreds in income taxes in your paycheck each month having a mortgage.

        **YOU KNOW YOU DESERVE YOUR OWN HOME SO LET ME HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT**
Basically, if you have a credit score of 620-you can buy now-620 down to 580-programs available to help assist in the buying process. You work so hard for your money and when you rent, it is like throwing it out the window. You just see no rewards!
When you own a home you will see a difference in thousands every year from the difference of your mortgage payment verses what you paid for rent. You also receive hundreds in income taxes every month on that hard working paycheck. You also don't have to make as much income when you buy verses when you rent, (kind of a crazy thought huh?) You also will have much more of a house with the same payment of a mortgage verses a rental. Of course, let's not forget about the Investment! This giving you and your family the peace and stability you have worked so hard for. If you are ready to take that step, we are here to make it happen. Please send your credit score-annual income-how long at place of employment-phone number-are you in a lease now and when does it expire-any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past- Once we receive your information by text or email provided above, someone will be with you soon after. Thank you and I look forward to guiding you through the front door of your own home.  *My information is provided in the reply option above*
*The price listed is an estimated payment--everyone and every home is different*  All Virginia
          **Hurry while the rates are low and grab one of the many stunning homes available**

        Wonderful two-bedroom end unit available in east end of Del Ray, putting you halfway between the chic shopping of the Avenue and the essentials of Potomac Yard. 

In this three-level brick house, you'll have plenty of space and privacy. Upper level holds two bedrooms and full bath. 

Main level is your sunny living room with bay window and equally bright dining room as well as a kitchen that is cozy, but well rated by serious cooks for its layout and spacious cabinetry. The kitchen also includes side-by-side refrigerator, dishwasher and built-in microwave. From the main level, you can also step out to the large, two-level deck, which is great for morning coffee or evening get-togethers with friends. The level backyard gives you the joys of the outdoors and leads to the off-street parking space. 

Downstairs, you'll find a large rec/entertainment room, which serves as a private getaway for watching tv, hitting your exercise equipment, or catching up on that work you brought home. This level also is home to a half bath and the laundry room, with full-size washer/dryer.

Pets are welcome here and will find much to like. That front bay window is a hit with felines and the fully fenced front and back yards allow Fido and friends to get outside when you don't want to take a walk. 

One-year lease. Non-smoking. Tenant pays utilities.

        **YOU KNOW YOU DESERVE YOUR OWN HOME SO LET ME HELP YOU ACHIEVE THAT**
Basically, if you have a credit score of 620-you can buy now-620 down to 590-programs available to help assist in the buying process. You work so hard for your money and when you rent, it is like throwing it out the window. You just see no rewards!
When you own a home you will see a difference in thousands every year from the difference of your mortgage payment verses what you paid for rent. You also receive hundreds in income taxes every month on that hard working paycheck. You also don't have to make as much income when you buy verses when you rent, (kind of a crazy thought huh?) You also will have much more of a house with the same payment of a mortgage verses a rental. Of course, let's not forget about the Investment! This giving you and your family the peace and stability you have worked so hard for. If you are ready to take that step, we are here to make it happen. Please send your credit score-annual income-how long at place of employment-phone number-are you in a lease now and when does it expire-any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past- Once we receive your information by text or email provided above, someone will be with you soon after. Thank you and I look forward to guiding you through the front door of your own home. 
*I am a licensed real estate agent and partnered with an excellent licensed lender.  My information is provided in the reply option above*
*The price listed is an estimated payment--everyone and every home is different* All Virginia

        Utilities are included in the rent except for cable, but Electricity and water are included. My wife and I are relocating, and are assisting my landlord with finding a new tenant. We will be slowly moving out of the residence from now until June, but wanted to get a start on finding someone. It's a 2 bedroom, 1 bath that is only about 900 or so feet, but the floor plan makes it seem a lot bigger. It comes with a storage area, and it's very quiet, and extremely safe, with lots of friendly neighbors, and a playground area for those with kids.

I will be posting pictures very soon, but for those whom are seriously interested, please feel free to contact Rob @

        Basically, if you have a credit score of 620+ you can buy now, at least 600, programs available to help assist in the buying process. You work so hard for your money and when you rent, it is like throwing it out the window. You just see no rewards!
When you own a home you will see a difference in thousands every year from the difference of your mortgage payment verses what you paid for rent. You also receive hundreds in income taxes every month on that hard working paycheck. You also don't have to make as much income when you buy verses when you rent, (kind of a crazy thought huh?) You also will have much more of a house with the same payment of a mortgage verses a rental. Of course, let's not forget about the Investment! This giving you and your family the peace and stability you have worked so hard for. If you are ready to take that step, we are here to make it happen. Please send your credit score-annual income-how long at place of employment-phone number-are you in a lease now and when does it expire-any foreclosures or bankruptcies in the past- Once we receive your information by text or email provided above, someone will be with you soon after.  I am a licensed professional real estate agent and my information is provided in the reply option above, thank you*

        Modera Avenir Place
offers living with style and grace.
But it's next to the Metro,
so right from the get-go
you're just minutes from Downtown's fast pace.

Living in lovely Dunn Loring
is quiet, but it's never boring
There are restaurants and shopping -
the neighborhood's hopping -
so you can do lots of exploring.

If you visit Modera Avenir,
you'll definitely want to move here.
It'll have a Harris Teeters
so all you big eaters
know grocery shopping's nothing to fear.

Exercise fans needn't pout:
there's a gym here for you to work out.
There's also two pools
so you're equally cool
lifting or just laying out.

With Modera Avenir on the scene
the homes are so nice it's obscene.
The kitchen's gourmet
so wouldn't you say
this apartment is fit for a queen?

Do you have a pet? Never fear -
Dogs and cats are welcome here!
and it's not a mirage:
we've got a garage!
All you pet-owning drivers can cheer!

If you want to live in ""the future""
Avenir will definitely suit you!
Get it? It's a pun!
We like to have fun.
But we'll stop with the corny French humor.

Close to Merrifield, Tyson's Corner and Mosaic
These apartments are anything but basic.

 WALKSCORE: 74 Why Arrowood Parc is the best place to come home to in the Vienna area

""Great location in lovely Vienna, VA! Walking distance to excellent elementary school (Louise Archer). Restaurants and Whole Foods are less than a mile away. Easy access to Vienna METRO and I-66."" -- Resident 

""I have been living in this community for 7 years. The location is good for someone who has limited use of a car. The metro is a 15 minute walk.  The neighbors around me were very nice and quiet. I would recommend living here. I have never had any problem with parking and in the winter the snow removal was done all the time."" -- Resident 

""Arrowood is a great place to live!! The location is amazing, close to 66 and close to many restaurants and supermarkets. Management has been great to us and they have addressed any minor issues we had in a prompt and effective manner. The complex is always very clean, the people in the community are very nice and friendly."" -- Resident Cats Allowed / Dogs Allowed

There's also two pools
so you're equally cool
lifting or just laying out.

With Modera Avenir on the scene
the homes are so nice it's obscene.
The kitchen's gourmet
so wouldn't you say
this apartment is fit for a queen?

Do you have a pet? Never fear -

we've got a garage!
All you pet-owning drivers can cheer!

If you want to live in ""the future""

know grocery shopping's nothing to fear.

Exercise fans needn't pout:
there's a gym here for you to work out.
There's also two pools
so you're equally cool
lifting or just laying out.

With Modera Avenir on the scene
the homes are so nice it's obscene.
The kitchen's gourmet
so wouldn't you say
this apartment is fit for a queen?

Do you have a pet? Never fear -
Dogs and cats are welcome here!
and it's not a mirage:
we've got a garage!
All you pet-owning drivers can cheer!

If you want to live in ""the future""
Avenir will definitely suit you!
Get it? It's a pun!
We like to have fun.
But we'll stop with the corny French humor.

Close to Merrifield, Tyson's Corner and Mosaic

""Great staff, safe, modern amenities, convenient front desk service. I also like how there is an open green square in the front of the building."" -- Resident 

""I can't recommend this place enough!! I lived here from 2/2013 - 2/2014. I did not realize how amazing this place was until I was gone. The other apartment complex we moved to just wasn't as good, and we both missed this place so much that we just had to move back here!! We are now so happy to be back at the Madison."" -- Resident 

""Cars will get towed out of the garage if they do not have a parking pass or permit - we love this!! Maintenance is very responsive. Pet friendly apartments. Huge windows that let in a lot of light. 24/7 free coffee machine - it makes hot cocoa, lattes, mocha's, etc. The apartment complex is always so clean. They truly do an amazing job keeping this property looking great."" -- Resident

What people are saying about Pentagon City

""Moved in 8/15/14, out 2/28/15. Picked this complex after visiting a dozen or more in the greater Pentagon, Ballston, Clarendon area. Price is competitive and often less than others for comparable sized apartment. Management and concierges are superb."" -- Resident 

""While pets are allowed, owners recognized the need for leashes and caution at all times...barking was next to non-existent, and NEVER at night."" -- Resident 

""Great sense of community, wonderful staff, you get what you pay for, the front desk is always present. The apartments are very well insulated so there is little to no need for the heating during winter. During summer it gets hot outside and the apartments keep cool."" -- Resident

        OPEN HOUSE SUNDAY, APRIL 26th, 2015
FROM 11am-3pm

Beautiful Single Family Detached Home
$2,990 per month with a 1 year lease

925 N. Montana St.
Arlington, VA 22205

 * 4 Bedrooms, 2 Full Bathrooms, Living Room, Kitchen, Deck, and Ginormous Family Room with a wet bar
 * Highest point in Arlington County, from the Deck you can see the Washington Cathedral and downtown DC
 * Located in the Dominion Hills / Westover Section of North Arlington
 * Two blocks from McKinley Elementary School
 * Walking distance to East Falls Church Metro.

The house has 2,300 square feet of space. The floor plan of the house is:
 * 18 x 13 Living Room with working fireplace
 * 10 x 6 . Dining ""L"" off Living Room
 * 12 x 13 Bedroom 1
 * 12 x 11 Bedroom 2
 * 12 x 8 . Bedroom 3
 * 12 x 13 Bedroom 4 with big closet and a shoe wall
 * _8 x 6 . Bathroom 1

 * 12 x 6 . Wet Bar with second microwave and mini fridge
 * 12 x 12 Utility / Laundry Room
 * 16 x 8 . Deck
 * 15 x 20 Storage (semi-finished attic with shelving)

Unlike most of the houses with this style, this was built on a hill so the front door of the house is at ground level, but the back of the house is at a lower elevation giving it a ground level walk-out from the rec room in the lower level. There is a HUGE 10 foot bay window looking out over the fenced back yard. The back yard is filled with trees and foliage providing a feeling of privacy as well as insulation from wind and noise. One of the other nice things is that since it is at the highest point in Arlington County, the downstairs is cool and dry, but never floods.

There are a lot of other great things about this house:
 * Central Air Conditioning and Natural Gas Heat
 * Washer and Dryer (natural gas)
 * FiOS High Speed Internet, DirecTV and Comcast already installed
 * Off-street parking in private driveway for two large cars or three small ones
 * East Falls Church Metro is exactly 0.6 miles from the house via the bike path
 * Elevated Deck with a beautiful view 
 * The back yard is fenced in
 * A 100% smoke-free house
 * Working wood fireplace, great for kids toasting marshmallows or just a cozy fire
 * NEWLY REFINISHED Hardwood floors throughout the house
 * HUGE Family Room / Rec-Room downstairs with a wet bar / mini-kitchen.
 * Nice neighbors who are either retired or young couples, many with children

But wait! There's more!!

If you have children, this house is in the perfect location! Following is the list of assigned schools for growing kids in this neighborhood:

What people are saying about Parc Dulles

""I have lived at Parc Dulles for a couple years.. Very nice property with great amenities! The office staff is professional and helpful. By far the best apartments I've lived in. I highly recommend if looking for a place in the Loudoun/Fairfax area."" -- Resident 

""My husband and I lived at Parc Dulles for a little over a year. Our only reason for leaving was the purchase of our first home. Throughout our 15 month stay, we had little to no problems with our apartment."" -- Resident 

""We felt that the management and office staff were always friendly and helpful. And if we were to live in an apartment again, we would not hesitate to rent from Parc Dulles again. I felt that the apartment itself felt more like home than our previous apartment in Fairfax."" -- Resident

""Great location in lovely Vienna, VA! Walking distance to excellent elementary school (Louise Archer). Restaurants and Whole Foods are less than a mile away. Easy access to Vienna METRO and I-66."" -- Resident 

""I have been living in this community for 7 years. The location is good for someone who has limited use of a car. The metro is a 15 minute walk.  The neighbors around me were very nice and quiet. I would recommend living here. I have never had any problem with parking and in the winter the snow removal was done all the time."" -- Resident 

""Arrowood is a great place to live!! The location is amazing, close to 66 and close to many restaurants and supermarkets. Management has been great to us and they have addressed any minor issues we had in a prompt and effective manner. The complex is always very clean, the people in the community are very nice and friendly."" -- Resident

        OPEN HOUSE! 
 TODAY FROM 1 PM TO 3 PM, APARTMENT 204 NORTH IN CRYSTAL TOWERS.
 I am looking for two roommates to rent two bedrooms in a 3-bedroom apartment in Crystal City available Saturday, May 30, 2015 for one-year lease. My roommates are both relocating out of the area in a few weeks when our lease is up. The building is Crystal Towers, Apartment 204 in the north side tower.

 The rooms are $1090 and $1050 based on size. Each bedroom has carpet, a large window with great sunlight, individual temperature control, and a generous closet. You will also have a full hallway linen closet and a shared storage closet in the apartment. The two rooms share a full bath. 

 A little bit about the apartment:
 - Directly across the street from the Crystal City metro stop for easy commuting to the city.
 - Full size washer and dryer in unit (the BEST!)
 - Large fully furnished living room, dining room, kitchen, and a huge balcony with flowers and an herb garden (no extra furniture needed but we can make room if you need to bring items)
 - Great building amenities like a pool, BBQ area, and a gym which is being redone this week with new equipment. Amenities fee has already been paid so you are not responsible for that.
 - Front desk security and package pickup
 - $35 a month for digital cable/wireless internet 
 - There is first come, first serve surface level parking or reserved underground garage spaces for a fee. There is also plentiful street parking.
 - Utilities are not included and vary from month to month -- average about $80 apiece.
 - The building requires an application, credit check, and background check from all potential residents.

 The building is near shops, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. It's also not far from Pentagon City Mall, Costco, and Pentagon Row. It is a very safe, convenient location.

 A little bit about me: 30 years old, originally from Massachusetts, career focused working as a television producer. I travel often for work and am also in graduate school part time. I am laid back and enjoy a glass of wine or a happy hour during the week and spending time exploring the city with friends on weekends. In my free time, I perform with a local dance company, love to cook and bake (and share with roommates!), and am active in my church community. If you are interested, please tell me about yourself. 

 Hope to hear from you soon!

""Great staff, safe, modern amenities, convenient front desk service. I also like how there is an open green square in the front of the building."" -- Resident 

""I can't recommend this place enough!! I lived here from 2/2013 - 2/2014. I did not realize how amazing this place was until I was gone. The other apartment complex we moved to just wasn't as good, and we both missed this place so much that we just had to move back here!! We are now so happy to be back at the Madison."" -- Resident 

""Cars will get towed out of the garage if they do not have a parking pass or permit - we love this!! Maintenance is very responsive. Pet friendly apartments. Huge windows that let in a lot of light. 24/7 free coffee machine - it makes hot cocoa, lattes, mocha's, etc. The apartment complex is always so clean. They truly do an amazing job keeping this property looking great."" -- Resident

        This posting is for a 2 bedroom 1 bath, 1100 sqft apartment right in the heart of Reston, VA. The apartment is approximately 1/4 of a mile from the Reston Town Center, amazing parks, Lake Anne, and shopping. This apartment has been our home for over two years, and it is really a great place to live. 

My family has recently purchased a home and are going to be vacating our apartment soon. However, we are not at the end of our lease. The current lease expires in September of 2015 at which time the lease would need to be renewed (by you). You would also need to pass a credit/income/background check with the apartment management office. 

With it being spring, you will not find an apartment like this in the Reston area at this price. Please contact me if you would like additional information - thank you!

        Looking for a 25-35 year old to takeover my spot on the lease with two other adults. The apartment community is quiet with lots of amenities. http://www.bozzuto.com/apartments/communities/101-park-place-at-van-dorn is the link to the complex for more details. The two remaining roommates are relatively quiet and hope any potential roommate share that lifestyle. The room potential roommate would also have a very large walk-in closet. Any potential roommate would have to pass the complex's renting background check and take over my spot on the lease.

I would recommend living here. I have never had any problem with parking and in the winter the snow removal was done all the time."" -- Resident 

""Arrowood is a great place to live!! The location is amazing, close to 66 and close to many restaurants and supermarkets. Management has been great to us and they have addressed any minor issues we had in a prompt and effective manner. The complex is always very clean, the people in the community are very nice and friendly."" -- Resident Cats Allowed / Dogs Allowed

        Think you need to pay asking price for your rental?  Not necessarily!  Using a realtor to help you find a home to rent has multiple advantages.  You gain access to many listings that aren't posted on Craigslist or other public sites.  In addition, a relator can help negotiate the best rental price and terms for you.  Like I just did for clients in September, who rented an apartment in Del Ray.  I found them a place they wanted and then negotiated a lower monthly rent amount, saving them hundreds over the course of a year.  Contact me today to discuss how I can help you in your search!

You will love all the amenities of this condo that shows like a model home. Upscale living at its BEST! Ideal for 1 person.  Awesome location only a few minutes from DC at 395/King Street (Rt 7) by Xsport Fitness Gym. 1 exit from Shirlington and across King from Fairlington/Arlington.

- 1 Minute drive from assigned parking to I-395 on-ramp
- 7 Minute drive to Pentagon, Pentagon City Metro, and Pentagon Mall
- 8 Minute drive to DC
- 10 Minute drive to Old Town Alexandria
- 5 Minute drive to Shirlington Town Center

Previous tenant said ""One of the best features about the location of this apartment, for me at least, has been the running trails. I am just 1 mile from Shirlington Village (which has Harris Teeter, all the eateries, a library, and a contemporary theater). Shirlington Village connects to 3 different trails: 4-Mile Run trail, WO&D trail, and the Mt. Vernon trail which runs straight into Old Town in one direction, and into DC in the other. It's 5 miles out on the Mt Vernon trail, to the airport where you can watch the planes take off (and that one is a really flat trail), making for a perfect 10-mile out-and-back.""

""Great staff, safe, modern amenities, convenient front desk service. I also like how there is an open green square in the front of the building."" -- Resident 

""I can't recommend this place enough!! I lived here from 2/2013 - 2/2014. I did not realize how amazing this place was until I was gone. The other apartment complex we moved to just wasn't as good, and we both missed this place so much that we just had to move back here!! We are now so happy to be back at the Madison."" -- Resident 

""Cars will get towed out of the garage if they do not have a parking pass or permit - we love this!! Maintenance is very responsive. Pet friendly apartments. Huge windows that let in a lot of light. 24/7 free coffee machine - it makes hot cocoa, lattes, mocha's, etc. The apartment complex is always so clean. They truly do an amazing job keeping this property looking great."" -- Resident

""Great location in lovely Vienna, VA! Walking distance to excellent elementary school (Louise Archer). Restaurants and Whole Foods are less than a mile away. Easy access to Vienna METRO and I-66."" -- Resident 

""I have been living in this community for 7 years. The location is good for someone who has limited use of a car. The metro is a 15 minute walk.  The neighbors around me were very nice and quiet. I would recommend living here. I have never had any problem with parking and in the winter the snow removal was done all the time."" -- Resident 

""Arrowood is a great place to live!! The location is amazing, close to 66 and close to many restaurants and supermarkets. Management has been great to us and they have addressed any minor issues we had in a prompt and effective manner. The complex is always very clean, the people in the community are very nice and friendly."" -- Resident

Why Ballston Park Apartments is the best place to come home to in the Arlington area

""I was very impressed by Ballston Park, especially the staff. Maintenance requests were always dealt with quickly, and they have pest management on a weekly basis for when you request it. It is the DC area, you will get bugs, but it was never an issue to deal with the front desk about it."" -- Colin S

""I've been here since April, and we haven't had any real problems.  Everything is really solid, and we don't often hear our neighbors inside our apartment,..Management has been super responsive when we've had issues."" -- Meg T

""I'm a girl in my early 20's, and I've never felt unsafe. I really love having a 24-hour CVS right there, not to mention a kabob place (open until 4am).. You're a mile away from the metro, but there are several buses that pick up really close by, and the trade off is definitely worth it for me."" -- Resident

Rent includes garage parking, valet trash, cable, upgrades and rent. This particular apartment is on the 2nd floor, above the retail shops. This apartment also includes outside storage and an additional large lockable metal storage area upstairs. Not all Camden Fairfax Corner apartments are renovated! This one is!! Granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, tile in kitchen & bath, beautiful dark brown laminate flooring in the living/dining room and carpet in the bedroom. Utilities (everything except electricity & internet) run around $42/month. Electricity through Dominion usually runs between $75 to $100 a month. We pay $47 a month for Cox high speed Internet and router.  The community is pet friendly (additional $40/month per pet) and is close to everything!

The community has 2 pools, a fitness center, outdoor grills, fun events like wine tastings and fun activities. The door to our building is between the Pilates studio and cigar shop. There are several great restaurants, a movie theater, shopping, ice cream and coffee shops just outside our front door. We really love living here and will miss it!

""I was very impressed by Ballston Park, especially the staff. Maintenance requests were always dealt with quickly, and they have pest management on a weekly basis for when you request it. It is the DC area, you will get bugs, but it was never an issue to deal with the front desk about it."" -- Colin S

""I've been here since April, and we haven't had any real problems.  Everything is really solid, and we don't often hear our neighbors inside our apartment,..Management has been super responsive when we've had issues."" -- Meg T

""I'm a girl in my early 20's, and I've never felt unsafe. I really love having a 24-hour CVS right there, not to mention a kabob place (open until 4am).. You're a mile away from the metro, but there are several buses that pick up really close by, and the trade off is definitely worth it for me."" -- Resident

It is the DC area, you will get bugs, but it was never an issue to deal with the front desk about it."" -- Colin S

""I've been here since April, and we haven't had any real problems.  Everything is really solid, and we don't often hear our neighbors inside our apartment,..Management has been super responsive when we've had issues."" -- Meg T

""I'm a girl in my early 20's, and I've never felt unsafe. I really love having a 24-hour CVS right there, not to mention a kabob place (open until 4am).. You're a mile away from the metro, but there are several buses that pick up really close by, and the trade off is definitely worth it for me."" -- Resident

Why The Springs at Reston is the best place to come home to in the Reston area

""Bike trails & shopping complex nearby. Bus stop in 2 corners of the complex. Direct buses to metro.. Enjoyed all of this facility when I was there. . . I loved my stay there. The apartment was way better than my previous apartments where I stayed."" -- Resident 

""Very close access to wooded trails - great for dogs! The complex does allow dogs (or at least used to) which is why we moved there. The apts. are within walking distance to a major supermarket, drugstore, dance studio, coffee shop and more and are very roomy (unlike the ones built today which usually have very small rooms)."" -- Resident 

""Hi I lived at this apartment for 2 years. First I lived in 2nd floor and then moved to a first floor... The apartment is more spacious when compared to other apartments. The rent is little bit less. I felt that the neighbors are really nice and really enjoyed my 2 year stay there."" -- Resident

        Superb 2 bedroom 2 bath condominium in the highly sought after Cameron Station community for rent. 

This 2nd floor corner unit features a unique layout and lots of natural lighting.  Upon entering, there is a short hallway that leads into the main living area with nicely separated rooms.  The large kitchen (centrally located and updated to new stainless appliances) has lots of cabinet space and is big enough to accommodate a small breakfast table.  There is even a pass-through where you can put a couple of bar stools on the other side and use as a eating area.  You probably won't find a better kitchen unless moving up to a 3 BR condo or townhouse.  The larger, master bedroom has a dedicated bathroom with shower, separate tub and dual vanities. It also features a large walk-in closet with racks/shelves. The second bedroom is located on the opposing side of the unit, next to the second bathroom (with a large walk in shower).  It contains a small closet and is perfect for a guest, child or a baby room.  There is a stacked washer and dryer in an enclosed space near the second bathroom.  

Tenant will have two assigned parking spaces, one inside the garage and the other in the rear of the condo. Building is surrounded by an abundance of extra street and visitor parking on every side...never short on parking spaces. This particular building is located in the more desirable Main Street area of the community, directly across Ben Brenman Park. Enjoy morning/evening strolls around the park (beautiful tree-lined walking paths with a pond and children's playground), which also plays host to a Farmer's Market, held every Sunday during the season. The unit is also very conveniently located right near the emergency stairwell, which also leads directly to the second parking space. A new restaurant is located on the ground level, and a dry cleaner, coffee shop and market are just on the other side of the street. The community pool is located just one block up, within very easy walking distance...great location with many amenities! 

The Van Dorn Street Metro Station is conveniently located within 1.5 miles and the community provides free shuttle service to and from the station during morning and evening rush hours. Old Town Alexandria is a few minutes drive down Duke Street and 495 & 395 are both within 2 miles of Cameron Station. A shopping center (Harris Teeter, Chipotle, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway and more) is 1/4 mile from community, which you can certainly walk or bike to. The community is very pet friendly and a dog park is located on the opposite side of Duke St.  As a community resident, you will have access to the gym/fitness center, indoor basketball court and pool. There is a close knit community feel and charm to Cameron Station (styled to mimic Old Town Alexandria) which offers a very safe, quiet and well maintained living experience. 

Asking $2200/month and is available immediately.  Please e-mail or call to view.
