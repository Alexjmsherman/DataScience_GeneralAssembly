""Great location in lovely Vienna, VA! Walking distance to excellent elementary school (Louise Archer). Restaurants and Whole Foods are less than a mile away. Easy access to Vienna METRO and I-66."" -- Resident 

""I have been living in this community for 7 years. The location is good for someone who has limited use of a car. The metro is a 15 minute walk.  The neighbors around me were very nice and quiet. I would recommend living here. I have never had any problem with parking and in the winter the snow removal was done all the time."" -- Resident 

""Arrowood is a great place to live!! The location is amazing, close to 66 and close to many restaurants and supermarkets. Management has been great to us and they have addressed any minor issues we had in a prompt and effective manner. The complex is always very clean, the people in the community are very nice and friendly."" -- Resident

Why Ballston Park Apartments is the best place to come home to in the Arlington area

""I was very impressed by Ballston Park, especially the staff. Maintenance requests were always dealt with quickly, and they have pest management on a weekly basis for when you request it. It is the DC area, you will get bugs, but it was never an issue to deal with the front desk about it."" -- Colin S

""I've been here since April, and we haven't had any real problems.  Everything is really solid, and we don't often hear our neighbors inside our apartment,..Management has been super responsive when we've had issues."" -- Meg T

""I'm a girl in my early 20's, and I've never felt unsafe. I really love having a 24-hour CVS right there, not to mention a kabob place (open until 4am).. You're a mile away from the metro, but there are several buses that pick up really close by, and the trade off is definitely worth it for me."" -- Resident

        The Point is offering $500 Visa Gift Cards to applicants who apply and are approved and move in by May 8th with a 12 month lease or longer!

 The Point at Silver Spring offers 3 different floor plans for our 1 bedroom apartments, all of which will come in traditional as well as renovated. To explain the differences to you, the traditional homes offer you a light oak wood cabinetry, laminate countertops and flooring, and your appliances will be either black, white or cream. The renovated apartment homes offer you a much more modern aesthetic to the home. They have cherry wood cabinetry, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and a built in microwave.

Now we do offer a laundry facility on every floor of our apartment homes as some of our apartments do not have a washer and dryer and none of our studio apartments have a washer and dryer. You will have access to the washers and dryers 24 hours a day.

Listed is our Traditional Washington 1 bedroom apartment for a 15 month lease quoted at $1469 with a move date of April 26th.
