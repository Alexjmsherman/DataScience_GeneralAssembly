        I'm a 24 year old looking to have some young professional roommates with me in this house! I am a school counselor in Arlington. I am very laid-back, friendly, and social. I enjoy running, cooking, and college basketball. I also am a big country music fan. It is a dog friendly house and I will be having a young Labrador with me. The land owner already approved my lab. I would also be open to other dogs in the house if you have one & if the landowner okay'd it! Please feel free to contact me if you would be interested! I am hoping to move in July/August but need roommates with me to make it affordable. The property is also close to Clarendon and the metro.

What people are saying about Pentagon City

""Moved in 8/15/14, out 2/28/15. Picked this complex after visiting a dozen or more in the greater Pentagon, Ballston, Clarendon area. Price is competitive and often less than others for comparable sized apartment. Management and concierges are superb."" -- Resident 

""While pets are allowed, owners recognized the need for leashes and caution at all times...barking was next to non-existent, and NEVER at night."" -- Resident 

""Great sense of community, wonderful staff, you get what you pay for, the front desk is always present. The apartments are very well insulated so there is little to no need for the heating during winter. During summer it gets hot outside and the apartments keep cool."" -- Resident

        This is a great house in Rockville on a quiet street but very close to Rockville Pike and a 7-min walk from Rockville metro. I've lived here for the past two years but my roommate is getting married and moving out. I like the house and location so much that I would really like to find a roommate and stay.  The current lease runs through the end of June but my current roommate is willing to move out a month early to accommodate a new tenant.

I am looking for a mature student or professional to sign a 1-year lease. I'd prefer a non-smoker. I would also prefer a light or non-drinker. Sorry no pets. You would have the bedroom pictured, which is on the first floor and your own bathroom, also pictured. The kitchen is large and beautiful, as is the living room. Gas range, granite countertops, separate dining area. I work a lot, usually 9am - 7ish and travel for work a decent amount so you will have the house to yourself a lot.

The couch, TV and dining room table are mine so it will be mostly furnished except for your room but there is also more space if you want to bring things in. I just took these pics today so they are a true representation.  There is also a shared office, which is also pictured.

Amenities:
- Laundry is in a shared space, accessible anytime
- Large deck off the kitchen with grill and medium sized yard
- Verizon Fios 50/25
- Off street parking (driveway)
- Several parks within walking distance

Move-in date is negotiable.  Any questions, just ask. I look forward to hearing from you.
